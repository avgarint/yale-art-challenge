                            online via Zoom. Attendance for in-person lectures
                            is limited to current members of the School of Art
                            community. This page serves as an archive of those

                            The Yale Arts Apprenticeship Program is an
                            initiative that connects Yale undergraduates,
                            particularly those on financial aid, with
                            professional arts practitioners of any discipline.

                            (SEA) funding model, the Arts Apprenticeship must
                            fulfill the same basic requirements.

                            Arts Practitioner and not with a company. The only
                            exception to this would be if the company overseeing
                            the apprenticeship were a registered non-profit
